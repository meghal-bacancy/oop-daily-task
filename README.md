## Day 1
Online Shopping System

Create a Product class with attributes:
1. ProductID(int)
2. Name(string)
3. Price(decimal)
4. StockQuantity(private int)

Implement Encapsulation:
1. Restrict direct access to StockQuantity (private).
2. Provide getter and setter methods (UpdateStock(), GetStockQuantity()).
3. Ensure StockQuantity cannot be negative when a product is added or purchased.

Implement:
1. Parameterized Constructor to initialize products.
2. Destructor to print a message when a product is removed from the system.
